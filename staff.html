                  I am hired as a Project Employee that mainly supports
                  translation services after being equipped with an N3 JLPT
                  Certificate. For years of working in Japan, the rich culture
                  has caught my attention that I wanted to apply the Japanese
                  way in my professional and personal stance. Until today, I
                  help different Japanese businessmen build their empire in the
                  Philippines through avenues that allow them to understand the
                  Filipino culture, bridging one nation with another.
